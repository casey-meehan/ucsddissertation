    \caption{\textbf{Left:} Reconstruction of an SSL training image from a crop containing only the background. The SSL model memorizes the association of this \emph{specific} patch of water (pink square) to this \emph{specific} foreground object (a black swan) in its embedding, which we decode to visualize the full training image. \textbf{Right:} The reconstruction technique fails on a public test image that the SSL model has not seen before.}
